    <h2>Professional Background</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
      I started my career after graduating University of California, 
      Irvine with a <strong>B.S. in Software Engineering</strong>. After graduating, 
      I began contracting as a Software Engineer with Avanos Medical. 
      At this time, I began working on my main project that would provide
      real-time identification of anatomical landmarks from an ultrasound 
      video input. From this project, I built an expertise in <strong>Python</strong> application
      programming, and working with the <strong>PyQt</strong> framework.
      
      <br><br>I learned the in's and out's of building Windows applications, and worked on the 
      <strong>C#</strong> launcher application. I also learned the proprietary Windows solution 
      <strong>Windows SIM</strong> used for deploying pre-configured Windows OS environments. 

      <br><br>I also worked on the data collection website which was a static 
      <strong>PHP</strong> website hosted through <strong>Amazon S3</strong> and was built with 
      <strong>BootStrap JS</strong>. We used a <strong>SQLite</strong> relational database that
      was related to an S3 bucket for data storage. 

      <br><br>During this time, I was brought on full-time as a <strong>Senior Software Engineer</strong>, and have 
      since contributing to multiple other projects that gave me experience in embedded engineering 
      (<strong>C++, C</strong>) and mobile engineering (<strong>Swift, Objective C</strong>).

    <p>
      I am a dual <strong>Canadian/American</strong> citizen. I was born in Victoria, 
      B.C., and lived there until I moved to California in 2009. I enjoy spending my 
      time <strong>driving</strong> and <strong>hiking</strong> up and down the continent. 
      
      <br><br>Growing up, I played <strong>Water Polo</strong> and was on the 
      varsity team my Freshman year of UC Irvine. I played the 2-meter defender position, 
      and was known for my fierce competitiveness and sportsmanship. I was captain of both 
      my high school teams in Canada and the U.S.

      <br><br>I am also an avid gamer, and my passion for software began when I participated in

    <h2>My Passion: Cooking/Baking</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
      An active passion of mine is cooking and baking. I grew up in a household that encouraged
      my siblings and myself to experiment and cook alongside our parents, and I find it to be an
      exciting part of my life to try all sorts of recipes that I've never made before. As of now,
      my favorite cuisines to cook are French and Indian, but I am constantly absorbing recipes 
      based on whatever seasonal ingredients I can get my hands on. 
      
      <br><br>From this passion, I've begun working on a <strong>recipe matching application</strong> 
      that will match any on-hand ingredients with recipes I have categorized from the web. I 
      hope to one day open my own cafe that I can use to "play with my food" and further 
      explore the culinary world.
