            I am a Senior Software Engineer at Avanos Medical. I joined my current company 3 years ago, and since then I have worked on several projects from the level of intern engineer to senior software engineer.
            <br><br>My main project in the company is working on a breakthrough Python AI software medical device that provides real-time identification of anatomical landmarks from an ultrasound video input. In this agile project, I implemented the application GUI and contributed to the backend connections to the Windows OS and hardware peripherals. I also owned the manufacturing process of tablet and software and have worked extensively with cross-functional teams to author robust software documentation. 
            At Avanos, I also worked as lead software engineer on a next-generation update of an existing therapeutic device. In this role, I worked alongside our systems engineer to produce the software architecture and beginning draft of the software requirements document. Sadly, the project was paused early in the project concept phase when Avanos announced their plans to close our site.
            <br><br>Before this position, I attended University of California, Irvine where I obtained a Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering.
            <br><br>Outside of work, I have been working on a personal recipe matching software that feeds off my passion for cooking to allow me to match ingredients I have on-hand to recipes I have scraped off the web. My hope is to build out a complete web application that I can provide online for free to encourage others to enjoy cooking.
