                  I am a Senior Software engineer at Tesla Motors. I work on their financial 
                  servicing team, owning the post-delivery lifecycle of all internally financed 
                  leases and loans in Tesla. My team is responsible for all communications, 
                  invoicing/collecting, and settling of these captive contracts. My team also
                  works closely with Tesla's internal accounting and reporting teams to report
                  on the health of our business unit, and provide on-call support for issues
                  occurring in our production environment. I lead a team of engineers and manage 
                  an intern, maintaining an ecosystem that handles 1+MM requests per day.
                  <br><br>
                  Before my current position, I was a Senior Software Engineer at Avanos Medical. 
                  I joined Avanos after graduation in Summer 2017, and worked on several projects 
                  from the level of intern engineer to senior software engineer. My main project 
                  in the company was working on a breakthrough Python AI software medical device 
                  that provides real-time identification of anatomical landmarks from an ultrasound 
                  video input. I also worked as lead software engineer on a next-generation update 
                  of an existing therapeutic device. In this role, I worked alongside our systems 
                  engineer to produce the software architecture and beginning draft of the software 
                  requirements document.
                  <br><br>
                  I attended University of California, Irvine from Fall 2012 to Summer 2017 where I 
                  obtained a Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering.
                  <br><br>
                  Outside of work, I have been working on a personal recipe matching software that 
                  feeds off my passion for cooking to allow me to match ingredients I have on-hand 
                  to recipes I have scraped off the web. My hope is to build out a complete web 
                  application that I can provide online for free to encourage others to enjoy 
                  cooking.
