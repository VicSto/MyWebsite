                  I am a Senior Software Engineer at Avanos Medical. I joined my current company 3 years ago, and since then I have worked on several projects from the level of intern engineer to senior software engineer.
                  <br><br>My main project in the company is working on a breakthrough Python AI software medical device that provides real-time identification of anatomical landmarks from an ultrasound video input. In this agile project, I implemented the application GUI and contributed to the backend connections to the Windows OS and hardware peripherals. I also owned the manufacturing process of tablet and software and have worked extensively with cross-functional teams to author robust software documentation. 
                  At Avanos, I also worked as lead software engineer on a next-generation update of an existing therapeutic device. In this role, I worked alongside our systems engineer to produce the software architecture and beginning draft of the software requirements document.
                  <br><br>Before this position, I attended University of California, Irvine where I obtained a Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering.
                  <br><br>Outside of work, I have been working on a personal recipe matching software that feeds off my passion for cooking to allow me to match ingredients I have on-hand to recipes I have scraped off the web. My hope is to build out a complete web application that I can provide online for free to encourage others to enjoy cooking.
